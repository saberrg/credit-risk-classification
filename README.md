# Credit Risk Classifications
Machine Learning Model that evaluates the risk of loans based on historical lending activity. Determines whether loans are healthy (0) or 
high risk (1).

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to use the data in "lending_data.csv" to train a logistic regression classifier then having it predict make predictions. An example of a supervised machine learning. Then the predication were examined to see how accuracte the model was making predictions on healthy and high risk loans.

# The Accuracy, Precision and Recall Scores
* For class 0, both precision and recall are 1.00, indicating that it performed exceptionally well in identifying class 0.
* For class 1, while the precision is slightly lower (0.87), the recall is still high (1.00), suggesting that the model correctly identified most  instances of class 1 while being somewhat conservative in making positive predictions.

# Summary Conclusion

According to the accuracy score the model averaged a 94%, which gives a high level of prediction accuracy. Since this was done twice and both times it received high scores in accuracy. I would highly recommend this model to the company for predicting which loans are safe and which aren't so.
